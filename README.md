# Happy Thoughts

This project was to create an app like Twitter where
you can post your happy thougths. I did it during Technigo's bootcamp, and I decided to re-write the code using Typescript

## The problem

The app is created using React. It fetches and collects data from an API That I have created for this project. I have a different component for the form that is used to post my happy thoughts and a different component for the posts that the app receives from the API. With React useEffect hook I fetch the data from the API when the App is mounted. I have implemented pagination so that the user chooses how many results per page are shown. In my Posts component I have used the useState hook to change the background color of the button when I like a post. The design follows the guidelines given for the project. This is my first attempt with Typescript and React
